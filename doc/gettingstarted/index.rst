Concepts
--------

Before you set up |product name|, make sure you understand some basic
terminology.
The following table provides descriptions for some of the terms
that are associated with |product name|:

   * - Term
     - Description
   * - Identity provider
     - An identity provider is a third-party identity system that
       integrates with Rackspace.
   * - SAML
     - SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is the protocol used
       to communicate between an identity provider and Rackspace.
   * - Attribute mapping
     - During the login process, the identity provider and Rackspace exchange
       SAML messages containing attributes about the user who is
       authenticating. An attribute mapping policy interprets these SAML
       attributes (also called *assertions*) to set Rackspace roles and
       permissions during login.
   * - Provisioned user
     - A provisioned user is a user created directly in the Rackspace Customer
       Portal. Provisioned users use the username and credentials that are
       created with Rackspace.
   * - Federated user
     - A federated user is a user who logs in to Rackspace by using Identity
       Federation. Federated users use the credentials provided and managed by
       their own identity system.
